## Introduction


As an example, we read the Feedback task fMRI region of interest data using the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package. This data comes shipped with the `NeuroUp` package in two forms: as an R dataset that you can directly call using `feedback` and as a `csv` file in the `extdata/` folder. Here, we load the data from the csv-file to mimic the expected use-case that you have region of interest data in a similar format:
```{r}
feedback_csv <- (system.file("extdata/feedback.csv", package = "NeuroUp"))
feedback_data <- readr::read_csv(feedback_csv)
```
